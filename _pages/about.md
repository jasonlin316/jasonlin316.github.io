I am a 2nd year PhD student in [FPGA/Parallel Computing Lab](https://fpga.usc.edu) at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/).
I'm interested in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), hardware accelerators, and heterogeneous computing. I have done projects in both FPGA and ASIC, details can be found in the project section of this page or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonlin316).

I finished my undergraduate study in National Taiwan University (NTU), majored in electrical engineering. I was also an Electrical Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard (HP), Taipei.
