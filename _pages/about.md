I am a 3rd year PhD student in [FPGA/Parallel Computing Lab](https://fpga.usc.edu) at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/).
I'm interested in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), hardware accelerators, and heterogeneous computing. I have done projects in both FPGA and ASIC, details can be found in the project section of this page or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jasonlin316).

In addition to research interests, I'm also interested in video editing and photography. Check out my [vlogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOgPUn4uH3eyITpOyIsteJNxuKTRnYb6v) and [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/194564724@N08/albums).
