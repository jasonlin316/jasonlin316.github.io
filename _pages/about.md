I am a Ph.D. candidate in [FPGA/Parallel Computing Lab](https://fpga.usc.edu) at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/).
I'm interested in Machine Learning Systems, Heterogeneous Computing, and Graph Neural Networks.
My research focus lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and High-Performance Computing Systems.
Please refer to the [publication](https://jasonlin316.github.io/publications/) page for more details.

I completed my undergraduate study in National Taiwan University (NTU), majored in Electrical Engineering. I was also an Electrical Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard (HP), Taipei. During my one-year internship, I [patented](https://tinyurl.com/4j42s3bx) my work as first author.

In addition to research interests, I'm also into video editing and photography. Check out my [vlogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOgPUn4uH3eyITpOyIsteJNxuKTRnYb6v) and [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/194564724@N08/albums).
